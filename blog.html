      <h1 class="article-title blog-title">My new journey as a bootcamp student.</h1>
      <p class="desc article-blog-desc">After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, I've
        made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet
        like-minded peers.</p>

      <h3 class="article-capture">How I stay committed to learning</h3>
      <p class="desc article-desc-blog">
        I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create
        simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
      <p class="desc article-desc-blog">While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning
        and
        most things about my journey with the world.</p>

      <h3 class="article-capture">How I got started</h3>

      <p class="desc article-desc-blog">I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes
        about what I was learning.
        After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short
        summaries of what I learned using my own words.</p>
      <p class="desc article-desc-blog">
        That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping
        others learn and stay motivated.
